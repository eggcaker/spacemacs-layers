* spacemacs-layers

My Spacemacs configuration. This includes dotfile (=init.el=) plus
layers.

Layers prefixed with =pelm= are opinionated personal
configuration layers. All others are /intended/ to be generally useful
for others (although in reality they may of course not be).

** Installation

To install these layers, clone this repository into your
=.emacs.d/private= directory. Then add the layers you want to enable to
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= in your dotfile.

for snippets work, you should link the =private= folder  to =~/.spacemacs.d=.
For this to work, you need at least Spacemacs version 0.103.

The fact that my =init.el= is present should not cause a problem.

If you are lazy guy, you can link the the ~init.el~ as =.spacemacs= file to get start.

** Contents
